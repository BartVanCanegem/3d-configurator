3D Configurator
===============
3D configurator is a web application that is powered by the [WebGL API](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/). [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/) is the abstraction layer on top of this low level API. 
This is purely a proof of concept that can be extended to a fully fetched project. The application in its current state only allows the configuration of basic structures with some additional features.
